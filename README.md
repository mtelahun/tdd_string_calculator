## [TDD Manifesto Excercise 2](https://tddmanifesto.com/exercises/)

Create a simple calculator that takes a String and returns a integer

Signature (pseudo code):

int Add(string numbers)

### Requirements

1. The method can take up to two numbers, separated by commas, and will return their sum as a result. So the inputs can be: “”, “1”, “1,2”. For an empty string, it will return 0.
